## Description

This was my bootcamp's second homework assignment or "challenge". In this challege we were told to make a portfolio website with a recent photo of ourselves, a way to contact us, a list of our projects, etc. This challenge is the culmination of all the knowledge I've learned in the first week of my bootcamp. Overall it took me a weekend to complete. I left out some commented out lines of code in the CSS to show how much I experimented trying to figure things out.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website allows employers or peers to see my projects. This allows them to estimate my growth and see how I made my first few websites. This is not our final portfolio website so it doesn't show my best work, just my first few ones. The website also lets people contact me via email or linked in.
